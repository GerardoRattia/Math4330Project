Question #1: Explain the differences made to Classical Gram-Schmidt to obtain Modified Gram-Schmidt. Briefly state why Modified is necessary.

  One of the main differences is that the Modified Gram-Schmidt method defines everything using i. there is also three forloops in the Modified Code vs to two forloops, this helps reducing rounding error to give a more accurate answer.
  
Question #3: Briefly explain the concepts of conditioning and stability and why they are necessary.

  Conditioning: Analizes how small changes changes in the algorithm affect the solution.
  There are two cases, ill and well.
  This cases can tell you whether or not changes have significant effect on the code.
  
  Stability: It checks the accuracy of your model using absolute and relative error. it helps problem to handle errors.
  There is two types of stability, forward and backwards. Backwards stability is stronger than forward.
  Backwards stability is really useful for building bridges, and composition of materials.
